# Releasing updates
1. Update version numbers
    - Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
        - Breaking changes incur a major version increment
        - Added functionality (non-breaking) incurs a minor version increment
        - Fixing bugs (non-breaking) incurs a patch version increment
        - Optionally include a pre-release suffix (e.g., `1.4.2-alpha`)
    - Version locations (as of 2021-04-20):
        - _package.json_
        - _Runtime/BehaviorTree.csproj_
        - _README.md_
            - Only update for non-pre-release versions
1. [Create a new release](https://github.com/asasine/BehaviorTree.NET/releases/new)
    - Tag version: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` targeting `main` (whatever version was decided above, with `v` prefix)
    - Title: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
    - Description:
        - Should have a single H1: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (YYYY-MM-DD)`
        - Can have a small paragraph after the H1 (e.g., a summary, link to a blog post)
        - Should have various H2 (omit an H2 if it would be empty):
            - New Features
            - Bug Fixes
            - Internal
        - Use an unordered list under each H2
            - Each list item should have the format `#PR/#Issue Past tense description (@user)`
            - `#PR/#Issue` uses the PR or Issue number from the change.
            - `Past tense description` should begin with one of:
                - Added
                - Changed
                - Fixed
                - Removed
            - `@user` is the GitHub username of the person who made the change.
    - Check `This is a pre-release` if `version < 1.0.0` or there's a pre-release suffix on the version (e.g., `0.1.1` or `1.4.2-alpha`)
